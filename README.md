Red Teaming Simulator

Overview:

The AI-Powered Red Teaming Simulator is a web-based application designed to simulate various cyber attack scenarios, allowing users to test their incident response skills. The simulator presents a series of events related to different attack types and prompts users to make decisions on how to respond. The application provides feedback on the user's choices, helping to improve their understanding of cybersecurity best practices.

Features:

 * Simulates multiple attack scenarios, including:

  - Targeted Phishing Campaign
  - Supply Chain Compromise
  - Ransomware Attack
  - Insider Threat Escalation
 * Interactive decision-making process with real-time feedback.
 * Engaging user interface with animations and responsive design.


How to Use:

1. *Clone the Repository*:
 
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   git clone 
   
2. Open the HTML File: 

   Navigate to the cloned directory and open the index.html file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or using the following command in your terminal:
  
   ```bash
   open index.html  # For macOS
   xdg-open index.html  # For Linux
   start index.html  # For Windows
   
3. Select an Attack Scenario: 

   In the simulator, you will see a dropdown menu labeled "Choose or Generate Attack Scenario." Select one of the available scenarios.

4. Start the Simulation: 

   Click the "Start Simulation" button to begin the scenario. The simulator will present a series of events related to the selected attack.

5. Make Decisions: 

   After each event, you will be prompted with questions regarding how to respond. Choose your response by clicking the corresponding button.

6. Receive Feedback: 

   After making a choice, the simulator will provide feedback on whether your response was correct or incorrect. It will also guide you through the next steps in the scenario.

7. Complete the Simulation: 

   Continue making decisions until the simulation concludes. At the end, you will receive a summary of the scenario.
   

How It Works:

    The simulator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    The attack scenarios and their corresponding events and responses are defined in a JavaScript object.
    When a user selects a scenario and starts the simulation, the application dynamically updates the content displayed on the page based on the user's choices.
    The application uses event listeners to handle user interactions and provide real-time feedback.
    The design is responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
